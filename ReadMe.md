# GreenJ ReadMe Statistics

This project is utilizes: TypeScript, JSON and GraphQL languages along with Node.js, Express.js, Apollo Client, Format.js, and Helmet.js libraries.

This project has a cloud Redis database and is deployed as a Docker container on [Render](https://render.com/) cloud hosting

## Quick implementations
platform - Platforms supported are Github, Leetcode, and Wakatime

route - Each platform has specific statistics that it can show with a route for each stat type

username - The username requested is based on the Username for the platform you are trying to reach. If you have diffeent usernames per platform you will need the corresponding username with the correct platform you are requesting.
